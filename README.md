# **Global Terrorism Dataset EDA**
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) has loads of information about terrorist activities across many years worldwide. But, there's a need to dive deeper into this data. We want to do a detailed study, find out trends, and see patterns in how terrorism happens. Our aim is to understand when and where attacks occur most, the ways they happen, who they target, and how different terrorist groups operate. By using data analysis techniques, we hope to get useful insights. These insights will help make better security plans, create effective policies, and find ways to deal with the changing challenges of global terrorism.

The GTD defines terrorist attacks as
'''The threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation'''
Our main goal from studying the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is to make the world safer and better prepared to handle terrorism. By understanding the data, we want to improve security plans and make smarter decisions for dealing with terrorism. The aim is to create strong strategies and work together globally to keep communities and countries safe from the threats posed by terrorism.
